This repository contains the analyses code used for the LEGEND clinical trial.

It uses a [`{targets}`](https://books.ropensci.org/targets/) workflow that 
includes all model fitting, evaluation and generation of figures and tables
presented in the (forthcoming) publication.


## `{targets}` workflow

```{r, results = "asis", echo = FALSE}
cat(c("```mermaid", targets::tar_mermaid(targets_only = TRUE), "```"), sep = "\n")
```
