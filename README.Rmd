This repository contains the analyses code used for the LEGEND clinical trial.

It uses a [`{targets}`](https://books.ropensci.org/targets/) workflow that 
includes all model fitting, evaluation and generation of figures and tables
presented in the (forthcoming) publication.


## `{targets}` workflow

```{r warning = 'FALSE', message='FALSE', results = "hide", echo=FALSE}
workflow <- targets::tar_mermaid(targets_only = TRUE)
```

```{r, results = "asis", echo = FALSE}


cat(c("```mermaid", workflow, "```"), sep = "\n")
```
