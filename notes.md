### first meeting notes:

L-U: replace unknown with No

zerotroponin porbs most usefull for troponin


CT:DA outpatient testing
 - or AN:AT

ignore AW:BD

can use ED and hospital lengths of stay instead of values in BH/BI (EDlos/hoslos)

DO:on are the outcomes to be used

control variables:
	> time from site start (start date is different from each hospital)
	

### Endpoints

#### Primary outcome 

- Hospital length of stay for patients with a presentation troponin <=2 
- Hoslos and zero_trop<=2 

#### Secondary outcomes (these endpoints need to be calculated for patients with a presentation troponin <=2 and for the entire cohort).  

- The proportion of patients discharged from hospital within 4 hours of presentation and without a subsequent AMI within 30 days  
  - Hoslos and thirtyevents 



- A cumulative composite endpoint of all-cause mortality, new non-fatal AMI within 30 days, or unplanned revascularisation within 30 days.  
  - Thirtyevents 

- Hospital length of stay, hospital representations and in-patient admissions over 6 months 
  - Hoslos, presentation_number, inpatientadmissions 



- Downstream testing: Stress testing, echocardiography, coronary angiography, coronary CT angiography up to 6 months after presentation 
  - EST through to MRI, then Outpatient_est through to outpatient MRI 
  - The EST through to MRI could be in any of the index or representations  

  - We would need a composite plus a table with the individual tests.  

- Cost effectiveness: incorporating healthcare utilisation up to 6 months after presentation and health-related quality of life 

  - Ignore this 

 
- Patient reported outcomes (quality of life) and patient experiences 6 months after presentation 

  - Experience_1 experience_2, eq5d_1 to eq5d_5 
  - Just descriptives required I think!
